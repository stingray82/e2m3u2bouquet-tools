# e2m3u2bouquet-tools
A set of tools for e2m3u2bouquet:

These tools have been retired please feel free to continue to use them the loss XCpanel means the bangs are no longer needed and Douggiemac has accepted the RTSP edit as a suggestion in e2m3u so no longer needed here, I will leave the code for people to see and maybe learn from but will not be updating this unless I have any more tools to add.

## e2m3u2bouquet (tvg-name) rather than tvg-id
Useful if your provider isn't a big supporter of Engima2 and uses the tvg-name tag for channel names rather than tvg-id

## e2m3u2bouquet config generator (V0.01)
A helpful script for people who use a single provider or are testing channel lists and using suls will ask questions on the following and generate the appropriate config file

* Username
* Password
* Domain & Port (I.e domain.com:6829)
* IPTV Player type i.e (1, 4097, 5001, 5002)
* VOD Player type i.e (1, 4097, 5001, 5002)

### Run the script - Run in Terminal or Putty
wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stingray82/e2m3u2bouquet-tools/master/e2m3u-Config-Setup.sh' -O '/var/volatile/tmp/config.sh' && chmod 777 /var/volatile/tmp/config.sh && sed -i 's/\r$//' /var/volatile/tmp/config.sh && /var/volatile/tmp/config.sh

Answer the questions and it will generate your config file

## Example of using e2m3ubouquets to generate CCTV Bouquets on Enigma2 Receivers using RTSP
Host it using free web hosting to generate your CCTV bouquets or even your lan storage server anywhere you can host a website
Contains a Picon that can be used an example M3U to upload.

**Given the fact it should have no effect on anyone I have asked that this modification is added to e2m3ubouquets and if accepted it will be depricated but the example m3u will stay as will the picon.**
